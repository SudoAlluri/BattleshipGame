# Citing Sources to Maintain Academic Integrity
**CS-1160 Wright State University | Dan Grahn**

While I expect that each student will be able to complete the labs and projects assigned using only the course materials, sometimes it may be useful to references external sources. If you receive assistance with your work from any source or person other than myself, the GTA, or the course textbook, you are required to explicitly cite the source and assistance provide. See below for examples.

## Citing a Person
```python
# Ada Smith (Student) helped me understand how to use a list comprehension to
# create a dictionary.
```

## Citing an Website
```python
# I referenced Stack Overflow to understand how to read in numbers.
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20449427/how-can-i-read-inputs-as-numbers
```

## Citing a Book
```python
# Python Basics (ISBN 1775093328) pg. 42 helped me with syntax for reversing
# iteration of for loops.
```
